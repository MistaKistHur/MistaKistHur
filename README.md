### 👽Hi there👽 ::>> Thanks for Stopping By. ☠️💀👻  

<span>My Names Tao & I Live in Norwich in the United Kingdom.</span>
<br>
<span>I Learnt the Basics of Html & Css in College, But never really followed it up.<br>
      Had Other interest's & different life circumstance back then<br>
      Tried to Get into University to Study Art Straight after college but didn't get Accepted<br>
      So Ended Up going Travelling instead, Visited The Philippines for 4 months & Thailand for 2<br>

      Kind of glad that I did not get Accepted into University, Because of the Huge ammount of debt
      in student loans associated with it, even though it would have been a good experience<br>
      Travelling was a whole experience in itself.<br>
